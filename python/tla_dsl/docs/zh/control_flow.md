# Python Staging and Runtime Control Flow

TLA kernel bodies are executed by Python while the frontend builds device IR.
This makes ordinary, inspectable Python staging code useful for deriving static
configuration before an operation is lowered.

## Python staging

Kernels and `@tla.jit` functions may call bare Python functions, lambdas,
nested functions, closures, class constructors, properties, and bound methods
while their values remain Python compile-time values. A bare helper executes as
ordinary Python in the caller's active frontend context, so its TLA operations
emit IR directly. It does not need `@tla.jit` merely to call TLA APIs.

A bare helper is never transformed independently. Its own TLA runtime control
flow is therefore unsupported: keep such control flow in the decorated caller.
Decorated-helper composition is reserved for the next control-flow follow-up.

```python
class TileConfig:
    def __init__(self, width: int):
        self.width = width

    @property
    def half_width(self) -> int:
        return self.width // 2


@tla.kernel
def kernel(limit: int) -> None:
    config = TileConfig(64)
    offset = (lambda value: value + 1)(config.half_width)
    tla.make_coord(offset, limit)
```

## Runtime control flow and promotion

Conditions and loop bounds backed by DSL values create runtime control flow.
Values written in such a region become runtime state. Promote a Python scalar
explicitly with `tla.as_numeric(...)` before assigning to it in a runtime
`if`, `tla.range` loop, `while`, or outlined DSL `with` region:

```python
@tla.kernel
def kernel(limit: int) -> None:
    index = tla.as_numeric(0)
    if limit > 0:
        index = index + 1
    tla.make_coord(index, 0)
```

Compose a fixed runtime collection with a comprehension over a literal
list/tuple of elements, wrapping every carried value with `tla.as_numeric`:

```python
state = [tla.as_numeric(value) for value in (0, 1)]
```

Container literals, partially promoted collections, and dynamic collection
iterables are not runtime promotion forms.

Reading a compile-time binding after it has been updated inside runtime control
flow is unsupported. Keep the promoted value or compute the later use inside
the runtime region.

## Object boundary

Dataclass values may be constructed, carried, and rebound in runtime control
flow when their fields are otherwise supported runtime values. Other
user-defined objects are staging-only: they cannot be kernel ABI arguments,
passed to `tla.as_numeric(...)`, or mutated in runtime control flow. Use tensor
stores for device-visible mutation and promote only supported scalar values or
fixed collections assembled with the supported comprehensions.

## `@tla.jit`

At Python scope, `@tla.jit` is a normal orchestration wrapper: it can call one
or more `@tla.kernel` launchers and does not create host MLIR, a host ABI, or a
host compilation cache entry. `@tla.kernel` remains the device compilation
entry point.
